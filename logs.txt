Out of Earth's ten most visited countries, seven are in Europe, with good reason.\n\nAlthough Europe is not one country, the ease of crossing borders might make you think otherwise, and transport infrastructure is generally efficient and well-maintained. At the other end of a short ride on a starkly modern [[high speed train]], a brief [[Flying|flight]], or an easy [[Driving|drive]], you will likely be able to delve into a new [[Phrasebooks#Europe|phrasebook]] and culture.\n\nEurope has cultural heritage dating back [[European history|more than three millennia]]: the continent has seen the rise and fall of [[Ancient Greece]] and the [[Roman Empire]], and birthed the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] and the [[Industrial tourism|Industrial Revolution]]. Countless kingdoms, republics and empires have left [[archaeological sites]] and [[old towns]] galore, and the most magnificent cathedrals in the world for you to explore. Aside from history, Europe is the home of high culture, is renowned for its diverse cuisines, and is justly celebrated for its exciting and romantic cities.\n\nEurope stretches from the shivering [[Arctic|Arctic Ocean]] in the north, to the pleasantly warm subtropical [[Mediterranean Sea]] in the south, and contains a vast array of temperate climates and variety of landscapes in between. The east of the continent is connected to [[Asia]], and for historical reasons a boundary is usually drawn from the [[Urals|Ural mountains]] via the [[Caucasus]] to the [[Aegean Sea]], while the continent's western extremities jut bracingly into the [[Atlantic Ocean]].\n\n",

Its landscape of famously flat lands, much of it reclaimed from the sea, is dotted with windmills, blooming tulip fields and picturesque villages. With over 17 million people living in a relatively small area, this is a densely populated modern European country. Still, even the largest of its cities have retained a rather laid-back small-town atmosphere and many are packed with historic heritage.\n\nThe country is commonly referred to as '''Holland''', but this name refers only to two of its twelve provinces and is unpopular among Dutch people who aren't from North or South Holland.\n\nAfter the Eighty Years' War (1568-1648) that led to the country's ''de facto'' independence from Spain in 1581, the Netherlands became a great naval power and one of the world's most powerful nations in a period known as the Dutch Golden Age. Because of its naval and trading history, this small nation boasts a wealth of cultural heritage visible in many towns across the country. This period also constituted a cultural peak that produced renowned painters like Rembrandt and Vermeer. Their works and many others fill the top-class Dutch museums that attract hundreds of thousands of visitors each year.\n\nOver the course of centuries, the Netherlands has gained a reputation for tolerance and progressivism: the country was the first in the world to legalize same-sex marriage and Dutch people generally have an open attitude to [[cannabis]] and prostitution. As a founding member of the EU and NATO and host to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, the Netherlands is at the heart of international cooperation.\n\nWith its international airport [[Schiphol Airport|Schiphol]] and its advanced network of motorways and international [[high speed train]] lines, the Netherlands is easy to reach from anywhere. Its small size, welcoming attitude and interesting sights make it a unique and easy to discover destination and a great addition to any European trip.\n\n",

Guernsey itself is the main island, some 50 miles west of Normandy; it's about 6 miles long by 3 miles wide, with St Peter Port as its chief settlement.\n\nIn 1066 William Duke of Normandy gained the crown of England, so his descendants ruled many parts of France as well as ruling England. A series of wars, and peace treaties followed by more wars, wrested control of French territory away from England to the growing kingdom of France, until all that remained were the Channel Islands. And so they remain today. The Bailiwick of Guernsey, like that of Jersey, is therefore a &quot;Crown Dependency&quot;. The Channel Islands are not subject to the UK parliament or legislation or - crucially - taxation in any way, but they cede control of defence and most international affairs to the UK. The rules of this arrangement are unwritten and all parties have shied away from testing them. \n\nGuernsey grew up as a fishing port but from 1700 found that smuggling paid better, as mainland taxes rose sharply. Even more lucrative was piracy (illegal) and privateering (much the same thing, but legal if it was against the King's enemies). The islands were occasionally fought over (eg during the English Civil Wars), but more often they were heavily fortified against invasions that never came. One such phase was during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, another was during the German occupation of the Second World War. So as they weren't attacked, the fortifications remain in good condition, and provide some of the main sights on Guernsey.\n\nPost-war development was faltering: light industry, tomatoes &amp; horticulture (undercut by the Dutch), and offshore finance (risky even when legitimate). Mass tourism never really started, and so Guernsey has concentrated on high-end tourism. Come here and feel like a swell. \n\n",

As a result, it has a rich and eventful history, and a strong basis for its booking tourism industry. \n\nIts heritage is reflected in its architecture, museums, galleries and monuments. Its landscape is varied, and extends from the [[Baltic Sea]] coast in the north to the [[Tatra Mountains]] in the south. In between, lush primeval forests are home to fascinating species of animals including bisons in [[Bia\u0142owie\u017ca]]; beautiful lakes and rivers for various watersports, the best known of which are in [[Warmi\u0144sko-Mazurskie]]; rolling hills; flat plains; and deserts. Among Poland's cities you can find the perfectly preserved Gothic old town of [[Toru\u0144]], Hanseatic heritage in [[Gda\u0144sk]] and evidence of the 19th-century industrial boom in [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]].\n\nToday's Poland has a very homogenous society in terms of ethnicity, language and religion. The historical Republics of Poland, whose boundaries were very different from those of today, were very multi-cultural, and, for a period, Poland was known as Europe's most religiously tolerant. Poland held Europe's largest Jewish population, which was all but wiped out by the Holocaust of World War II and after the war by the anti-Semitic communist government. \n\nPoland's western regions, including large parts of [[Lower Silesia]], [[Lubuskie]] and [[Zachodniopomorskie]], were parts of neighbouring [[Germany]] at different periods of time. The natural border of mountain ridges separating Poland from its southern neighbours, the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]], did not stop the cultural influence (and periodic warring). In the middle ages, Poland was part of a powerful Commonwealth with [[Lithuania]] that governed much of today's [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]]. The cultural evidence of it can be found closer to the present-day borders. Lastly, the entire eastern half of Poland used to be controlled by the Russian Empire, and there was a strong Soviet influence during the communist era, leaving behind many traces in both culture and built heritage.\n\nDespite losing a third of its population, including a disproportionally large part of its elites, in World War II, and suffering many economic setbacks as a Soviet satellite state afterwards, Poland in many ways flourished culturally in the 20th century. Paving the way for its fellow Soviet-block states, Poland had a painful transition to democracy and capitalism in the late 1980s and 90s. In the 21st century, Poland joined the [[European Union]] and has enjoyed continuous economic growth unlike any other EU country. This has allowed it to markedly improve its infrastructure and had a profound effect on its society. Creative and enterprising, Poles continually come up with various ideas for events and festivals, and new buildings and institutions spring up almost before your eyes, so that every time you come back, you are bound to discover something new.\n\n",

Even outside these areas, there are some beautiful landscapes, and all of Slovakia is covered by thousands of well-marked hiking trails.\n\nFor history lovers, Slovakia has the highest number of castles and chateaux per capita in the world, ranging from simple ruins to well-preserved habitable castles with furnishings, so if you are a fan of medieval history, look no further. There are also numerous [[Gothic]] and Baroque cities and towns across Slovakia, including the capital. There are also well-preserved examples of wooden folk architecture, including churches made entirely out of wood and the tallest wooden altar in the world.\n\nThere are numerous mineral and thermal springs in Slovakia, and around some of these world-famous spas have been built that offer great curative therapies or just simple relaxation.
